- What is the main problem with web pages build with HTML?
Since HTML has loose syntactical requirements, the author may use their own
syntactic preference which results in inconsistancy of syntax and stucture in
HTML documents.

- What is the advantage of XHTML?
XHTML has strict syntactic rules that impose a consistant stucture on all XHTML 
documents.

- Why did neither of these two standards established itself as the one and only 
page description method?
Firstly they are all active in the market and used widely by web document 
authors. Furthermore, they hold their own advantages.

- Describe the approach of using both simultaneously.
Compromise between the two. Adopt HTML5's new exciting features and follow 
strict syntax rules as is specified in XHTML.
